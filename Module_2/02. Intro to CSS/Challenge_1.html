        <h3>The Blue Morpho</h3>

        <p>
            The <em><strong>Blue Morpho</strong></em> is one of the most beautiful<br> <em>butterflies</em> in the world. The butterfly often eats<br> mud found in puddles and will use its mouth to<br> get nourishment from rotten fruits.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The insect has two hind and fore wings and two<br> antennas that are clubbed. You would easily spot<br> these colorful butterflies in the wild because they<br> have a black line that runs along their bodies and<br> white spots dotting that
            line. They also have blue<br> areas on each wing. </p>
        <p>
            The biggest threat to the Blue Morpho <em>butterfly</em> is<br> the <a href="https://www.rainforest-alliance.org/species/blue-butterfly" target="_blank"> deforestation of their natural habitats</a>.
