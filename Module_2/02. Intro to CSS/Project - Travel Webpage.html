        <h3 id="volcanoes">Volcanoes National Park</h3>
        <div>
            <P>
                The park's centerpiece, Kilauea, has been active as recently as 2018, and visitors should be aware that portions of the park are closed during periods of seismic activity that might pose a threat. Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, Volcanoes National
                Park offers a unique, close-up look at an active volcano system where lava seeps from fissures in the earth. The surrounding landscape is shaped by cooled lava rock, both old and new, which has flowed over roads in a display of its unstoppable
                force. During the area's most active periods, tourists have the chance of experiencing the thrill of feeling seismic activity, hearing the boom of gas emissions, or even seeing a pillar of ash escaping into the air. The park has many things
                to do and see, including the Thurston Lava Tube, the Jagger Museum, Devastation Trail, and the steaming Halema'uma'u crater. Address: 1 Crater Rim Drive, Hawaii National Park, Hawaii.

        <div>
            <p>The Kona Coffee Living History Farm is the only living history farm in the nation that is dedicated to the history and traditions of coffee farming. Costumed interpreters can be found throughout the grounds, going about daily tasks, from food
                preparation to farming chores, always happy to answer questions. Visitors are also free to explore the plantation, which still produces coffee, where you might even spot a Kona Nightingale. Visitors can also find tours of modern Kona coffee
                producers, including plantation tours at Hula Daddy and roasting facility tours at Mountain Thunder Plantation.
